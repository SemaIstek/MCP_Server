The term \"sesquipedalian\" comes from the Latin words \"sesquipeda,\" meaning \"half-dozen,\" and \"alians,\" meaning \"words.\" It was originally used to describe writers who used words that were longer than six letters.\\n\\nSesquipedalian individuals often use complex vocabulary and may be known for their love of words, language, and literature. However, this can also sometimes be seen as pretentious or overly verbose.\\n\\nThe term is often used in a humorous way to describe someone who uses big words incorrectly or in an excessive manner. For example, someone might say, \"He\\'s such a sesquipedalian, always using words like \\'perspicacious\\' and \\'enigmatic\\' when he doesn\\'t really mean them.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that the term \"sesquipedalian\" is not typically used to criticize someone\\'s intelligence or ability to communicate effectively. Rather, it\\'s often used to poke fun at someone\\'s love of language and their tendency to use big words in a way that may be perceived as overly elaborate or pretentious.\\n\\nIn general, being sesquipedalian can be seen as a positive trait, as long as it\\'s done in a lighthearted and playful way.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'llama3.2:1b', 'created_at': '2026-01-24T13:31:53.566916458Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 66018342906, 'load_duration': 43490877909, 'prompt_eval_count': 58, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1040757012, 'eval_count': 269, 'eval_duration': 20732330278, 'logprobs': None, 'model_name': 'llama3.2:1b', 'model_provider': 'ollama'}, id='lc_run--019bf033-402e-75c3-851f-ac77843baf75-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 58, 'output_tokens': 269, 'total_tokens': 327})"
